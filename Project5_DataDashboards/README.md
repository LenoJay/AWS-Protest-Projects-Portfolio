# Advanced Protest Data Aggregation & Dashboards

## Project Overview and Goals

**Overview:**  
This project aims to create an interactive analytics dashboard that aggregates protest data from multiple sources. Users can explore global protest trends through visualizations like heatmaps, trend graphs, and detailed reports.

**Goals:**
- Aggregate real-time protest data from various sources.
- Provide interactive dashboards for data exploration and trend analysis.
- Enable intelligent search and advanced analytics of protest data.

## Technologies and AWS Services Used

**Data Streaming & Storage:**
- **Amazon Kinesis:** Streams protest data from diverse sources.
- **S3:** Stores raw and processed protest data.
- **DynamoDB:** Provides fast, structured storage for aggregated data.

**Analytics & Visualization:**
- **Amazon QuickSight:** Creates interactive dashboards and global heatmaps.
- **Amazon Elasticsearch Service:** Enables full-text search and advanced analytics.
- **EventBridge:** Triggers data refresh and processing workflows.
- **CloudFront:** Accelerates content delivery.

**Additional:**
- **AWS Marketplace:** Leverages third-party analytics tools and datasets to enrich the analysis.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

1. **Data Ingestion:**
   - Set up Kinesis streams to collect protest data.
   - Configure Lambda functions to process and store data in S3 and DynamoDB.

2. **Data Aggregation and Processing:**
   - Use EventBridge to schedule periodic data refreshes.
   - Index data using Amazon Elasticsearch Service for search capabilities.

3. **Dashboard Development:**
   - Build interactive dashboards using QuickSight to visualize trends, heatmaps, and other analytics.
   - Integrate search features to allow users to filter and explore the data.

4. **Content Delivery:**
   - Configure CloudFront to ensure fast, global delivery of dashboard content.
   - Optionally, use AWS Marketplace tools to augment your analytics.
