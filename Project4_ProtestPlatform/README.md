# Comprehensive AI-Driven Protest Intelligence Platform

## Project Overview and Goals

**Overview:**  
This platform leverages a suite of AWS AI/ML services to analyze protest-related data across multiple modalities—text, images, and video—to generate actionable intelligence. Users can interact with the platform via a conversational chatbot and conduct intelligent searches over historical and real-time data.

**Goals:**
- Ingest and analyze multimodal protest data (text, images, videos).
- Derive insights using NLP, computer vision, and predictive models.
- Provide a conversational interface for data querying.
- Enable intelligent search across a repository of protest information.

## Technologies and AWS Services Used

**AI/ML Services:**
- **Amazon SageMaker:** Trains and deploys custom ML models for classification and prediction.
- **Amazon Comprehend:** Performs NLP-based sentiment and topic analysis.
- **Amazon Rekognition:** Analyzes images/videos for protest-related content.
- **Amazon Lex:** Offers a conversational interface for querying protest data.
- **Amazon Kendra:** Enables intelligent search over historical and real-time data.

**Supporting Services:**
- **AWS Lambda & Kinesis:** Orchestrates data ingestion and processing pipelines.
- **S3:** Stores raw and processed data.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors system performance and logs events.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage:**
   - Configure Kinesis streams to ingest real-time protest data.
   - Set up S3 buckets for storing raw data and processed outputs.

2. **Model Training and Analysis:**
   - Use SageMaker to train custom models using historical protest data.
   - Deploy models to process new data via Lambda functions.
   - Integrate Comprehend for NLP analysis of textual data (news, social media).

3. **Conversational Interface and Search:**
   - Build a chatbot using Lex to allow users to query the system.
   - Integrate Kendra to enable intelligent search across stored protest data.

4. **Monitoring and Optimization:**
   - Use CloudWatch to monitor system metrics and performance.
   - Set up alerts for anomalies or model performance issues.
