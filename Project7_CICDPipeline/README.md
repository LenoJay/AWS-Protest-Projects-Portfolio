# CI/CD Pipeline for Serverless Protest App

## Project Overview and Goals

**Overview:**  
This project establishes a fully automated CI/CD pipeline to continuously integrate, test, and deploy a serverless protest application. It emphasizes infrastructure as code and robust monitoring to ensure rapid, secure, and consistent deployments.

**Goals:**
- Automate the build, test, and deployment process for serverless applications.
- Implement infrastructure as code for reproducibility and scalability.
- Monitor deployments and receive notifications for failures or issues.
- Integrate project management tools to streamline DevOps workflows.

## Technologies and AWS Services Used

**CI/CD & DevOps:**
- **AWS CodePipeline:** Automates the CI/CD process.
- **AWS CodeBuild:** Compiles and tests application code.
- **AWS CodeDeploy:** Deploys serverless functions and applications.
- **AWS Lambda:** Executes custom deployment tasks and post-deployment validation.
- **AWS CloudFormation:** Manages infrastructure as code.
- **AWS CodeStar:** Provides unified project management for DevOps workflows.
- **CloudWatch:** Monitors deployment logs and system metrics.
- **SNS:** Sends notifications regarding build and deployment statuses.
- **CloudTrail:** Audits deployment-related activities and changes.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Instructions

1. **Repository Setup:**
   - Organize your code in a Git repository and connect it to AWS CodeCommit or GitHub.
2. **Pipeline Configuration:**
   - Create a new pipeline in CodePipeline that triggers on code commits.
   - Configure CodeBuild to compile and run tests on your code.
   - Set up CodeDeploy to handle the deployment of Lambda functions or other serverless resources.
3. **Infrastructure as Code:**
   - Write CloudFormation templates to define your serverless infrastructure.
   - Integrate these templates into the pipeline for automated deployment.
4. **Monitoring and Notification:**
   - Set up CloudWatch to monitor logs and performance metrics during deployments.
   - Configure SNS and CloudTrail to send alerts and audit deployment activities.
5. **Project Management:**
   - Use AWS CodeStar to manage your CI/CD project and track progress.
